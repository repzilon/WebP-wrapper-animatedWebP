MULTI-TARGETING AND PLATFORM INFO
=================================

IDE and .NET implementation support
-----------------------------------
There will be two sets of .NET targets depending on the IDE used to open the solution.

$(VisualStudioVersion)' != '17.0 :
* Visual Studio 2017
* Visual Studio 2019

$(VisualStudioVersion)' == '17.0 :
* Visual Studio 2022
* Visual Studio 2022 for Mac
* JetBrains Rider 2024.x for Windows and Mac

DotDevelop (a successor fork of MonoDevelop) support is planned. Versions of Visual Studio older
than 2017 cannot open SDK-style projects. There is still a separate Visual Studio 2010 solution
targeting .NET Framework 2.0, if you need.

Visual Studio 2017 cannot handle neither .NET Core 2.2 or newer nor Unified .NET (>=5.0).
Visual Studio 2019 supports .NET Core 2.2, 3.0 and 3.1 and Unified .NET 5.0 (no 6.0 or later).
Visual Studio 2022 dropped support for .NET Framework 4.0 and 4.5.x but added support for .NET 6.0 .

.NET Framework 2.0 also covers 3.0 and 3.5 as they use the same JIT and only .NET Framework 2.0
features are used (i.e. no WPF, no LINQ). .NET Framework 4.0 uses another JIT and is here for
Windows Server 2003 (a legacy-only scenario). .NET Framework 4.6 enables support of Windows
Vista/Server 2008 up to Windows 10 and its server variants. Its 64-bit version includes RyuJIT
which generates better machine code for CPU-intensive tasks. As no extra functionality of newer
.NET Framework is used, newer .NET Framework versions will not be targeted (they will use the
DLL for .NET Framework 4.6).

.NET Core 1.x cannot be supported because it lacks the needed System.Drawing.Common.
.NET Core 2.1 and 3.1 are the ones supported because they had longer support periods.
However, for the Windows Forms test project, as far .NET Core is concerned, only versions
3.x have the System.Windows.Forms assembly.
.NET Standard does not make much sense in this project because of operating system support
(read below).

For Unified .NET, only 5.0 (because it was the first) and even versions (as there are LTS)
will be supported. However, targets will be added only if specific functionality is added.

Operating system support
------------------------
For runtime support, I decided to keep it Windows only. The supplied DLLs are Windows-only
and porting of GDI+ to other operating systems has been abandoned. If you want WebP support
for Mac and Linux, use SkiaSharp, which has some Microsoft backing and built-in WebP support.
Well, SkiaSharp is also available on Windows, so use this wrapper library for Windows-only
legacy scenarios.

And because of the above, neither Xamarin nor Mono support will be provided. SkiaSharp also
works on Xamarin, by the way.

So why support Visual Studio and Rider for Mac then? Because you should not be locked in to
a platform to read and inspect source code.
